# Concerts.io backend

This is an express-based backend for the concerts.io application. It currently provides the react front-end with concert and artist data sourced from a mockaroo api and the ticketmaster api. It also allows for users to link their spotify or last.fm accounts to acquire music listening data. Once this project reaches the database integration stage, concert data will be sourced from the ticketmaster api and our own database that will store saved concerts and artists for individual users.
